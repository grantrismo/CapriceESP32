# CapriceESP32
(A version for the Odroid GO Hardware)
# Introduction
At the time the Amstrad CPC came out in the 80th, I was fascinated on what lies within the creativity of computer games. It was my first computer where me and my brothers spent days and nights playing games. What a perfect time looking back from now. It was also the time I got fascinated by how a computer works, I have started to learn digital science and computer programming, finding hacks and game cheats in first place. Well, there is always a way to start with :-)

Now, sever centuries later, I came in touch with the Odroid GO by searching for ESP32 programming and evaluation board references. I liked already the ESP8266 for doing some nice IOT projects on my own for home automation purpose. Then, after purchasing an Odroid GO, I have started to upload some nice EMUs checking some games.

Well, then I was looking for a Amstrad CPC EMU for the Odroid GO. As far as I know, there is no public version available. I was caught by the idea playing my favorite games I was addicted to in my youth 30 years later on this tiny ESP32. How could such a big machine fit to half a square inch of space?

Then I started with the end of mind. Searching for a simulator platform saving me some development time capable to develop the wrapper on a decent PC. On the Amstrad CPC, I searched for a good starting point to develope from. I decided to go for the Caprice Palm OS version. It was the most flexible and most decent version of the original Caprice32 version. Still a mystery to me how to develop an EMU. Well done Ulrich Doewich and Frederic Coste! Every thing else is history.

Here we go, a first pre-release of the ESP32, Odroid GO version of the Caprice CPC engine is made available here. What needs to be done to get going is described below.

# Preparing the SD Card

whatever_sd_card_name_you_take/
- /cpc/dsk  :: Search path for DISK images
- /cpc/cps  :: Default snapshot path (not used yet)
- /cpc/scr  :: Default screenshot path (not used yet)
- /cpc/cmf  :: Holding the cheat (cheat mode format) files
- /cpc/kmf  :: Default keymap file path

It is very important to setup the SD card accordingly. Without that it wonâ€™t work. This configuration is uses to be standard compliant to Odroid GO Emulator setup. In general used to keep multiple EMUs organized on one single SD card. The /cpc/dsk path may contain sub-directories. Please not that sub-directories cannot be stepped into at the moment. So please put all your *.dsk disk images into the root directory of: /cpc/dsk.

# Compile from source

Normally, there is no need to compile from source. The repository contains two executable versions.  One to use with :>make flash (monitor), the other as a FW image which can be loaded through the Odroid GO Firmware process. As platform, the esp_idf version 3.2 is uses. It is basically the standard Odroid GO development platform. I have added also Cmake support for the actual esp_idf version 4.x for testing purpose. It should compile, however, I have stopped development on 4.x because no performance improvements determined.

# Running the Emulator

After compile and flash, or FW upload, you should see the Amstrad/Schneider CPC 6128 start screen. How to navigate is described in the usermanual.pdf document.

Have Fun!
